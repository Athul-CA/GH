- Git and GitHub Differences
- Git Basics
    - Repo
    - Commits
    - Issues & PR 
- GitHub Student Developer Pack

---
# Let's Go Hands on Today :zap:

--- 
## I'm Assuming
You've got
- Git Installed
- GitHub Account
- Git GUI Client(Optional)

---
### Code will be in these
```
Colour Blocks (nightOwl)
```
and in this `colour`


---
### Getting used with Git

---
### Fire Up a Terminal Window :fire:
Bash or Command Prompt

---
Let Git know who you are

```bash
$git config --global user.name "your_username"
$git config --global user.email "hello@example.com"
```
---

GitHub uses the email address set in your local Git configuration to associate commits pushed from the command line with your
GitHub account.

---

###  Let's setup a base Project

---

```bash
# creating a new folder for our project
$ mkdir MyProject

# changing Directory to our Project folder
$ cd MyProject

# Initalize the current folder as a new Repository
$git init

Initialized empty Git repository in 
/Users/athul/Desktop/MyProject/.git/
```

---
`$ git init`
- Initializes an empty Git Repository

---
### Make your First Commit

---

Commits are **Checkpoints/Snapshot** of the state of your 

Repository(project) at a particular time

---
```bash
#create a new file
$ touch fruits.txt
# check status of repository
$ git status
# add file to staging area
$ git add fruits.txt
# commit the file
$ git commit -m "Add fruits.txt"
```` 

---

Git file status lifecycle

---

Always make **meaningful** commit messages

---
`$git diff`

Shows the Differences between the current state and prvious state of a file if any exists

---
This is the output of `$git diff`
```
diff --git a/fruits.txt b/fruits.txt
index c69849c..7e57fda 100644
--- a/fruits.txt
+++ b/fruits.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 Apples
 Oranges
 Grapes
+Avocados

```
---
To get diff of staged files use the '`--cached`' flag

`$ git diff --cached`

---
`$ git log`

Shows the list of Commits with their details

in your Repository

---

```bash

    Add fruits.txt
```

---
`$ git log --online --graph`

```bash
* 060e478 (HEAD -> master) Add Grapes
* 4e82c5d Add Oranges
* 938317d Add Apples
* e466572 Add fruits.txt
```
Shows all the commits as a graph

---

Here is a better example

```bash
* d8b54f6 ‚ú®Makefile and setting version by tag (#11)
*   4e31879 Merge pull request #10 from athul/error_bubbling
|\  
| * 426c416 üõ† Headers print in a single loop
| * bd19b81 ‚ú®Added a Better formatter for json
| * e46f57c fix install from script link
| * ce06aa4 sending errors to stderr
| * fb3ec99 explicitly close response body
| * e7296b0 bubbling errors up to main() instead of panicking
|/  
*   6f797bf üîÄMerge pull request #9 from athul/ctypes
```

---
## Reset Your commits
Go back in time ‚è≥

---
```bash
# To reset files from Staging area
$ git reset [options]

# To reset a particular commit or file
$ git reset HEAD/file_name [options]

# Options include

--hard # resets code and commits
--soft #resets code and commits but keeps in staging area
--mixed #resets commits and keeps in working directory
```

---
## Branches

Branches helps to us to isolate the code and work independently without changing the base code
