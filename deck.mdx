### What is a Hackathon????

Wikipedia says<br></br>
`A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event; 
often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development,     
including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.`

### What hackathons means to me
> `There's no where else in the world you can spend 24 hours in a room full of people who are passionate about what you'ew passionate about, who all want to help each other learn and grow. That's the story to tell üòç`
<br></br> Joe Nash(MLH)
