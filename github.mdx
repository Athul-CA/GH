## WHat is Git? 🥁

<code style={{color:`cyan`}}>Git is a Distributed Version Control System.</code> 

More Simply, it is a tracking software which tracks files.

---

It's more like <b><u style={{color:`red`}}>Google</u></b> 😝 but `git` tracks on Files. 

It was developed by **Linus Torvalds** *(yeah the same guy)* in 2005 to manage updates on the Linux Kernel<br/><br/>

---

Git helps in managing and track different versions of software. This in turn makes collaboration easy and hassle free.

## What is GitHub????

<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/baracktocat.jpg" height="500" width="500"/>

</Invert>

---

It is a Platform where you can <br/>**host code**, <br/>**Collaborate** and <br/>**Contribute** to code :tada:

---

More Simply GitHub is basically a website <br/>which runs git **under the hood**, <br/>so you can view your repositories online<br/>
<center>🤓</center>


---
You can use GitHub to  
<ul>
<Appear>
<li>host your Project's Source code📦</li>
<li>Make Open Source Contributions🤝,</li>
<li>Host your Website✨ </li>
<li>and much more.....</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---
Even the software making this presentation is on GitHub and is Open Source 😛

---
### Git/GitHub Repositories
A <b style={{color:`slateblue`}}>repository</b> is like a Folder on your computer.<br/><br/>
A repository holds your Project and changes.<br/><br/>
The only difference between a usual folder and a Git repository is that it contains a (*hidden*) `.git` folder.

---
A GitHub Repository can hold anything from Code to Multimedia Files to large binaries. <br></br>The upper limit on the size of a repo being 1 GB

---
### Git Branchesᛘ
Branching allows each developer to <b style={{color:`cyan`}}>branch out from the original code base</b> and <i style={{color:`hotpink`}}>isolate their work</i> from others.<br/> It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.

---
## Commit 📸
A commit is a **Snapshot** of your Repository State identified by a unique HASH. Commiting is same as **Saving** a File

---
# [Demo Time](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free)
We'll look into
- git commits
- git branches
- git merge

---

### Some GitHub Jargon

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li><b>Star</b> ⭐️: Give the Repository/Project a 👍</li>
    <li><b>Fork</b> : Copy the Repository as your Personal One </li>
    <li>Clone 👥: A local version of a repository or a download .</li>
    <li>Issues❕: Report Bugs, Feature Request or Feedback to a Repo</li>
  </Appear>
</ul> 

---

#### Some more Jargon
  <ul>
  <Appear>
  <li>Pull Request 🔀: Contribute to a repo with fixes or code</li>
  <li>Pull Requests and Branches are Integral for contibuting to code.</li>
  </Appear>
  </ul>

---

A *fork* is a <b style={{color:`crimson`}}>copy of a repository</b>. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

---
The whole Git Tree Structure can be seen from the `Network` tab in the repo Insights.

---
<img alt="issues" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athul/GH/master/img/branches.png"/>

---
### GitHub Issues
Issues provide a way to <b style={{color:`cyan`}}>provide Feedback</b> to the maintainers who work the project.<br></br><br></br> Issues are a great way to keep track of <u style={{color:`hotpink`}}>tasks, enhancements, and bugs</u> for your projects.

---
Issues boost productivity by 💯.
<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>You can keep track of requests/bugs on  your projects</li>
    <li>Help other contributors get the gist of the Issue with labels</li>
    <li>Plan your Work in an efficient way</li>
    <li>Here is an Example of the issues and labels of Gatsby JS 👉</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

### GitHub Pull Requests
Pull Request are a way through which developers collaborate on GitHub.<br/><br/>They provide a user-friendly web interface for discussing proposed changes before integrating them into the official project.

--- 

Pull requests lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. 

Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

---
Pull Requests basically work with <code style={{color:`red`}}>branchesᛘ</code> and <code style={{color:`yellow`}}>forks⑂.</code><br/>

Either you can open a PR from another branch or from a fork.

---
