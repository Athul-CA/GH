## WHat is Git? 🥁
`Git is a Distributed Version Control System.`<br/> More Simply, it is a tracking software which tracks files.

---
It's more like **Google** 😝 but `git` tracks on Files. 

It was made by Linus Torvalds*(yeah the same guy)* in 2007 for one of his projects. Furthur digging showed that it is made in a Data Structure called Merkle Tree

### Git/GitHub Repositories
A **repository** is analogous to a Folder on your local system.<br></br><br></br>
