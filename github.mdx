# GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages can be used to host Static Websites directly from your repository.     
You can access GitHub Pages from the Repository Settings and you'll get a website like `<your_gh_username>.github.io`     
---
You can direct it to any custom Domain,You can even Host a Blog from GitHub Pages(using Jekyll).    
Try to always deploy your site from a new branch called `gh-pages` this way you, won't have to change any settings.
---
# Pull Requests
Pull Request lets you change the code of another repository . By making pull request with changes to the code, You "contribute" to that repository.   
We can review the Pull Requests to make the code more effective to our repo.
