### What is a Hackathon????

---

<Invert>

**Wikipedia says,**<br/><br/>
`A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event; 
often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development,     
including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.`
